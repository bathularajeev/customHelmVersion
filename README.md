# kubernetes helm

Auto-trigger docker build for [kubernetes helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) when new release is announced

[![DockerHub Badge](http://dockeri.co/image/alpine/helm)](https://hub.docker.com/r/alpine/helm/)

## NOTES

The latest docker tag is the latest release version (https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/latest)

Please avoid to use `latest` tag for any production deployment. Tag with right version is the proper way, such as `alpine/helm:3.1.1`

If you need run `kubectl` with `helm` together, please use another image [alpine/k8s](https://github.com/alpine-docker/k8s)

## Additional notes about multi-arch images

This feature was added on 23th May 2021.

1. Version 3.5.4 and 3.6.0-rc.1 are manually pushed by me with multi-arch image supported
2. Older version will be not updated as multi-arch images
3. Newer vesions from now on will be multi-arch images (`--platform linux/amd64,linux/arm/v7,linux/arm64/v8,linux/arm/v6,linux/ppc64le,linux/s390x`)
4. tag `latest` doesn't suppoort multi-arch yet, because I can't find a good way to tag it only without rebuild it.
5. I don't support other architectures, except `amd64`, because I have no other environment to do that. If you have any issues with other arch, you need raise PR to fix it.
6. There would be no difference for `docker pull` , `docker run` command with other arch, you can run it as normal. For example, if you need pull image from arm (such as new Mac M1 chip), you can run `docker pull alpine/helm:3.5.4` to get the image directly. Remember, it doesn't support `latest` tag with multi-arch image yet.

# Usage

    # mount local folders in container.
    docker run -ti --rm -v $(pwd):/apps -w /apps \
        -v ~/.kube:/root/.kube -v ~/.helm:/root/.helm -v ~/.config/helm:/root/.config/helm \
        -v ~/.cache/helm:/root/.cache/helm \
        alpine/helm

    # Run helm with special version. The tag is helm's version
    docker run -ti --rm -v $(pwd):/apps -w /apps \
        -v ~/.kube:/root/.kube -v ~/.helm:/root/.helm -v ~/.config/helm:/root/.config/helm \
        -v ~/.cache/helm:/root/.cache/helm \
        alpine/helm:3.1.1

    # run container as command
    alias helm="docker run -ti --rm -v $(pwd):/apps -w /apps \
        -v ~/.kube:/root/.kube -v ~/.helm:/root/.helm -v ~/.config/helm:/root/.config/helm \
        -v ~/.cache/helm:/root/.cache/helm \
        alpine/helm"
    helm --help
    
    # example in ~/.bash_profile
    alias helm='docker run -e KUBECONFIG="/root/.kube/config:/root/.kube/some-other-context.yaml" -ti --rm -v $(pwd):/apps -w /apps \
        -v ~/.kube:/root/.kube -v ~/.helm:/root/.helm -v ~/.config/helm:/root/.config/helm \
        -v ~/.cache/helm:/root/.cache/helm \
        alpine/helm'

# Why we need it

Mostly it is used during CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous delivery) or as part of an automated build/deployment

# The Processes to build this image

* Enable Travis CI cronjob on this repo to run build daily on master branch
* Check if there are new tags/releases announced via Github REST API
* Match the exist docker image tags via Hub.docker.io REST API
* If not matched, build the image with release version and push to https://hub.docker.com/
* Get the latest version from https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/latest, pull the image with that version, tag as `alpine/helm:latest` and push to hub.docker.com
